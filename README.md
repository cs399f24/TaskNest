# TaskNest

A web-based application for keeping track of tasks in a users given day.

Using React for the front-end presented to the user using `AWS S3`
The back-end of the application is hosted on a `AWS EC2` instance using `flask` and `AWS DynamoDB` to store data
`AWS Cognito` to support users for the application. Notifications will use the Unix Timestamp in the database and alert users of deadlines, or times when a task is to be completed.

### Documentation:
- Full documentation on the instance settings regarding `S3`, `EC2`, and `AWS Cognito`.
- Full documentation explaining the `launch_aws.sh` file.
- all documentation can be found at: `@/docs/`

## Available Scripts

To use the react scripts you must first run the following command to download project dependencies:

##### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

<!-- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

For a database we will be using DynamoDB

the value of `"time"` is a unix time stamp.

`user#1` in this case will be the user's id probably a hash generated by AWS Cognito.

DynamoDB table will have the following structure:
```JSON
{
    "user#1": {
        "name": "John",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "name": "Task 1",
                "time": "1730143672"
            },
            {
                "name": "Task 2",
                "time": "1730143672"
            },
            {
                "name": "Task 3",
                "time": "1730143672"
            }
        ]
    },
    "user#2": {
        "name": "Jane",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "name": "Task 1",
                "time": "1730143672"
            },
            {
                "name": "Task 2",
                "time": "1730143672"
            },
            {
                "name": "Task 3",
                "time": "1730143672"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
