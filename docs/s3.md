# S3
- Name: task-nest-test-bucket-1
- Block public access is off
- Static web hosting is enabled
- When enabling static web hosting, also make sure that index document is `index.html` and same thing for error document

- When Updating bucket run `npm run build` then use the following command to upload the built front-end:
`aws s3 cp ~/Desktop/CodingProjects/Python/TaskNest/build/ s3://task-nest-test-bucket-1/ --recursive`
In the command above you can replace `~/Desktop/CodingProjects/Python/TaskNest/build/` with the path to your build folder with an absolute path as shown above or a relative path from your pwd.
- Bellow is the buckets policy:
```json
